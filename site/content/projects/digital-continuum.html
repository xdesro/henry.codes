        <h1>The Digital Continuum</h1>
        <p>The Digital Continuum site was a project I worked on at Universal Mind for a new framework they were launching. The Digital Continuum as a whole is a huge collection of content which laid out the foundations for enterprise companies to be successful in their digital delivery. I was an interaction developer for this project and helped build out the site, a large-scale static site generator.</p>

        <h2>Tooling</h2>
        <p>Digital Continuum is built on Hexo static site generator, uses Contentful, an API-first headless CMS, and deploys with Netlify. The codebase of the site is EJS templates and Sass.</p>

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>My primary responsiblilities for this project were templating and styling. A senior developer created the content models for the site’s content and provided API endpoints for templates to hook into. </p>
                <p>The content modeling is fairly complex and is broken down into Mindsets, Segments, and Elements — Elements are children of Segments and Mindsets. One element can relate to multiple mindsets, but can only occur in one Segment, etc. </p>
