        <h1>Initiative</h1>
        <p>Iniative was a concept visual design for a tabletop RPG companion app. The app would include features like automated dice rolling, dynamically-populated character sheets for any gaming system (Dungeons & Dragons v. Pathfinder v. Deadlands), and a graphical inventory with item tracking for things like currency, ammunition, etc.</p>

        <p>San Francisco UI is the system font for iOS devices. Originally  I had been working on an Android  version of the mockup, and was using Roboto as the main font, but  when I switched to the iOS version, SF was the way to go.</p>

        <h2>In Re:</h2>
        <p>This was a labor of love, mostly. I’m a huge fan of tabletop RPG gaming, and saw a place in the community for a really smooth, comprehensive, easy-to-use companion app to ease with menial mathematical/bookkeeping tasks that can sometimes detract from the roleplay experience. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, I’d love to build out Initiative. I think there’s still a place for it in the market, and I think it’d be a welcome entry in the tabletop community. Until then, it was a really fun foray into app design, and a great introduction to design tools like Sketch that I wasn’t very familiar with.</p>
